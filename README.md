# AR-Ecommerce

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
I worked on AREcommerce, an innovative e-commerce platform designed to enhance user experience by allowing customers to interact with products in a 360-degree view and experience them in augmented reality (AR). The goal was to bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping, helping users make more informed purchasing decisions.

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:
One major problem in online shopping is the lack of physical interaction with products, which often results in uncertainty about product size, appearance, or functionality. This leads to high return rates and lower customer satisfaction, as users can't fully visualize products in their environment.

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
We developed a feature that allows users to view products in a 360-degree angle and integrated AR support so users can visualize how the product would look in their real environment using their device’s camera. This helps customers get a more realistic view of the item, making their shopping experience more immersive and informed.

➤ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
I was responsible for the full-stack development of the platform, focusing on integrating the 360-degree product view . I worked on implementing frontend and backend  for the Website development. One challenge I faced was optimizing the rendering performance of 3D models for different device types, which we overcame by implementing lazy loading and asset optimization techniques(future Work).

➤ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:
Working on the AREcommerce project helped me grow significantly as a developer. I gained a deeper understanding of 3D rendering and AR technologies, especially how to optimize complex models for various devices without sacrificing performance(Future Work). I also learned how to manage real-time interactions between users and virtual content, which expanded my knowledge of user experience design for immersive applications.

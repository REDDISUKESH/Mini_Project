# AR-Ecommerce

## Project Idea
My project, AREcommerce, is a next-generation e-commerce platform designed to enhance user experience and purchasing decisions. We developed a feature that allows users to view products in a full 360-degree angle, providing a comprehensive and interactive visual of the item. Additionally, we've integrated augmented reality (AR) support, enabling users to see the product in their real environment through their device's camera. This innovative approach aims to bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping by offering a more realistic view of products, thus helping users make more informed purchasing decisions
